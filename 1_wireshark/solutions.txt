# Trace 2: FTP

# Trace 3: Traceroute
## Briefly describe how the traceroute tool works including which network protocols are in use.

	The traceroute tool is used to find the path of the IP addresses used to get from the host machine to the 
	destination IP address. To do this User Datagram Protocol is used to send packets to the next device along
	path. The initial packet will have a Time-To-Live (TTL) value of 1, which gets decremented for each IP 
	address passed through from host to destination. When the TTL value reaches zero the current IP address in 
	the path will send an ICMP echo back to the host saying TTL value exceeded. For this initial packet that 
	means it will tell us the first device in our path form host to destination. Traceroute will then send out 
	another UDP packet with TTL value 2, which will find the second IP address in the path. The next UDP packet 
	will have a TTL value of 3, and this pattern continues until the destination is reached, giving the host an 
	entire list of IP addresses passed through to get to the destination.

	In OS X it appears that traceroute will actually send out three packets in a row with the same TTL value, 
	meaning they would get the first IP address three times in a row, followed by the second IP address three 
	times in a row, etc. I assume this is done incase a random packet gets dropped.	

## Give the source IP address that issued the traceroute command and the destination IP address.

	Source IP Address:		192.168.0.100
	Destination IP Address:		74.125.225.46

## List the IP addresses on the route between source and destination.
